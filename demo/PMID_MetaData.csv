19008416,Genomic loss of microRNA-101 leads to overexpression of histone methyltransferase EZH2 in cancer.,2009,01,05,2018,11,13,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2008,Dec,12,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a mammalian histone methyltransferase that contributes to the epigenetic silencing of target genes and regulates the survival and metastasis of cancer cells. EZH2 is overexpressed in aggressive solid tumors by mechanisms that remain unclear. Here we show that the expression and function of EZH2 in cancer cell lines are inhibited by microRNA-101 (miR-101). Analysis of human prostate tumors revealed that miR-101 expression decreases during cancer progression, paralleling an increase in EZH2 expression. One or both of the two genomic loci encoding miR-101 were somatically lost in 37.5% of clinically localized prostate cancer cells (6 of 16) and 66.7% of metastatic disease cells (22 of 33). We propose that the genomic loss of miR-101 in cancer leads to overexpression of EZH2 and concomitant dysregulation of epigenetic pathways, resulting in cancer progression.","Sooryanarayana_Varambally_Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA./Qi_Cao/Ram-Shankar_Mani/Sunita_Shankar/Xiaosong_Wang/Bushra_Ateeq/Bharathi_Laxman/Xuhong_Cao/Xiaojun_Jing/Kalpana_Ramnarayanan/J Chad_Brenner/Jindan_Yu/Jung H_Kim/Bo_Han/Patrick_Tan/Chandan_Kumar-Sinha/Robert J_Lonigro/Nallasivam_Palanisamy/Christopher A_Maher/Arul M_Chinnaiyan"

18787170,FBXW7 targets mTOR for degradation and cooperates with PTEN in tumor suppression.,2008,09,25,2018,11,13,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2008,Sep,12,"The enzyme mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a major target for therapeutic intervention to treat many human diseases, including cancer, but very little is known about the processes that control levels of mTOR protein. Here, we show that mTOR is targeted for ubiquitination and consequent degradation by binding to the tumor suppressor protein FBXW7. Human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors showed a reciprocal relation between loss of FBXW7 and deletion or mutation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), which also activates mTOR. Tumor cell lines harboring deletions or mutations in FBXW7 are particularly sensitive to rapamycin treatment, which suggests that loss of FBXW7 may be a biomarker for human cancers susceptible to treatment with inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.","Jian-Hua_Mao_Cancer Research Institute, University of California at San Francisco, 2340 Sutter Street, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA./Il-Jin_Kim/Di_Wu/Joan_Climent/Hio Chung_Kang/Reyno_DelRosario/Allan_Balmain"

To understand the logic underlying decision-making in the signaling network controlling CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth, we profiled the activation of several hundred transcription factors after cell stimulation. We assembled an in silico signaling network by connecting CB1R to 23 activated transcription factors. Statistical analyses of this network predicted a role for the breast cancer 1 protein BRCA1 in neuronal differentiation and a new pathway from CB1R through phosphoinositol 3-kinase to the transcription factor paired box 6 (PAX6). Both predictions were experimentally confirmed. Results of transcription factor activation experiments that used pharmacological inhibitors of kinases revealed a network organization of partial OR gates regulating kinases stacked above AND gates that control transcription factors, which together allow for distributed decision-making in CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth.","Kenneth D_Bromberg_Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA./Avi_Ma'ayan/Susana R_Neves/Ravi_Iyengar"

We describe a highly parallel multiplex methodology for screening large pools of shRNAs using half-hairpin barcodes for microarray deconvolution. We carried out dropout screens for shRNAs that affect cell proliferation and viability in cancer cells and normal cells. We identified many shRNAs to be antiproliferative that target core cellular processes, such as the cell cycle and protein translation, in all cells examined. Moreover, we identified genes that are selectively required for proliferation and survival in different cell lines. Our platform enables rapid and cost-effective genome-wide screens to identify cancer proliferation and survival genes for target discovery. Such efforts are complementary to the Cancer Genome Atlas and provide an alternative functional view of cancer cells.","Michael R_Schlabach_Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Genetics, Center for Genetics and Genomics, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA./Ji_Luo/Nicole L_Solimini/Guang_Hu/Qikai_Xu/Mamie Z_Li/Zhenming_Zhao/Agata_Smogorzewska/Mathew E_Sowa/Xiaolu L_Ang/Thomas F_Westbrook/Anthony C_Liang/Kenneth_Chang/Jennifer A_Hackett/J Wade_Harper/Gregory J_Hannon/Stephen J_Elledge"

We have devised a massively parallel strategy for screening short hairpin RNA (shRNA) collections for stable loss-of-function phenotypes. We assayed from 6000 to 20,000 shRNAs simultaneously to identify genes important for the proliferation and survival of five cell lines derived from human mammary tissue. Lethal shRNAs common to these cell lines targeted many known cell-cycle regulatory networks. Cell line-specific sensitivities to suppression of protein complexes and biological pathways also emerged, and these could be validated by RNA interference (RNAi) and pharmacologically. These studies establish a practical platform for genome-scale screening of complex phenotypes in mammalian cells and demonstrate that RNAi can be used to expose genotype-specific sensitivities.","Jose M_Silva_Watson School of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA./Krista_Marran/Joel S_Parker/Javier_Silva/Michael_Golding/Michael R_Schlabach/Stephen J_Elledge/Gregory J_Hannon/Kenneth_Chang"
